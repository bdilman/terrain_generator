# Terrain Generator
A wizard written in python that helps in creating realistic terrains for *Gazebo* with appropriate textures and lighting.
Terrains are generated using the heightmap provided by the user which is stored either on disk or as a URL.

Heightmaps are basically rasterized images that contain information about *surface elevations*. Using this elevation information we can create beautiful terrains.

<img src="/images/island.png" height=200 width=200>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://image.ibb.co/gafPCT/terrain.png" height=200>

The wizard basically does the following:
- Asks you simple questions regarding the model
- Resizes the input image to *2<sup>n</sup>+1 x 2<sup>n</sup>+1* pixels and converts it into grayscale
